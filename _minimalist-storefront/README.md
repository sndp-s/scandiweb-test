> Cart functionality is not complete as I have ran out the time I can allocate to this project. Also due to the same reaons I had to resort to using functional component at one place inorder to be able to fetch params from the router (I could not go back and redo the routing with an older version as that would be time consuming and is simplistic task) A lot of my time and effort was invested in bringing it to the currect state, I would appreciate if you took a look at it. Feel free to ping me reagarding anything related to this position.
